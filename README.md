# Calculate time left till Christmas
Fun programming with the children <3, to get know when the surprise boxes appear :)

We're over the https://github.com/attilaberencsi/zbirthdays project in ABAP. But frankly children want instant results.

So for all of Us booting my ABAP/4 System on my laptop is time consuming, and needs my cooperation. Let's do it in JavaScript, and we'll publish it on github.io whenever we're ready. It will be awesome, even the classmates can use it on their/parents' mobiles as well, we will be responsive :).

BTW: This project aims to help young people understand the basic process how programs are born.

What is a development environment: like the stomach of your mother, they grown up there by Your creativity. This is actually Your wrench.

Publishing: this is the long night we spent with Mom in the Hospital to present Your little brother.

What is GitHub: from where the programs are coming, their store.

Where they live and play: on a server or a phone etc. as a new instance from the GitHub for example with cloning.

Good opportunity to show simple things like variables and data types, and elements on a page and their purpose.

Most importantly, this is really a fun for everyone, and not a constraint:

    Daddy, do You know why I love so much programming ?
    Tell me my Son.
    Becaue we can use mathematics, what I love so much!
